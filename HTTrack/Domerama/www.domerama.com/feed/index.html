				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are few geodesic decorations for the holidays, other than a very popular geodesic gingerbread house last year. I started thinking up of different ideas, except I wanted to go different and outside. It was also a way to use all those holiday lights I collected at yard sales throughout the summer.</p>
<p>I built a 4-foot (120 cm) diameter 3v 5/9 dome so I could easily go through standard doorways. The model was built with 1/2 inch EMT conduit. On top of it 5 &#8220;petal&#8221; sections were hinged so that they could open and close. Once all put together, a regular tarp fabric was put over the dome and I used a hot glue gun to affix the lights. For the petals I had some light curtains I found (12 inches wide X 6 feet long, or 30cm wide X 180cm long) and held in place with plastic tie-wraps (zip ties).</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13794" alt="snowflake_dome_closed" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snowflake_dome_closed.jpg" width="750" height="550" /></p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13796" alt="snowflake_dome_open" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snowflake_dome_open.jpg" width="751" height="571" /></p>
<p>To hold the petals at a specific height I ran a thin wire around all tips of the petals. This spreads the tension across all petals, keeping them at the same height. To adjust the height I simply wrapped the wire a few extra turns at each tip around the tip (if you look closely you will see that I left the bolts sticking out).</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13795" alt="snowflake_dome_on_balcony" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snowflake_dome_on_balcony.jpg" width="750" height="597" /></p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13797" alt="snowflake_gold_version" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snowflake_gold_version.jpg" width="750" height="535" /><br />
The goal is to build a 30-foot version of the snowflake dome and use some winch with airplane cable to extend and retract the petals. The green effect was created using a regular green spotlight under the structure.</p>
<p>If anyone has suggestions for improvements, please feel free to do so! We&#8217;d love to have a showcase page for holiday decorations based on geodesics.</p>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><strong></strong></strong>Take an interactive excursion through total darkness at the Tactile Dome, which reopens on Wednesday, October 30, 2013, at our new home at Pier 15. Crawl, slide, and bump your way through the pitch-dark Dome using your sense of touch as your only guide through its chambers and mazes.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Originally created in 1971, the Dome was designed and built by August Coppola (father of actor Nicolas Cage and brother of film director Francis Ford Coppola) and was rebuilt for Pier 15. Reservations are required.The Tactile Dome, a geodesic experience designed and built as a cooperative effort by <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/geodesichelp" target="_blank"><strong>TaffGoch, Gerry Toomey</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.domeincorporated.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Dome Inc</strong></a>., announces its Grand Opening on October 30, 2013. This is a bold and interactive experience, and is the feature exhibit in the new $375 million dollar<a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/tactile-dome/1971-press-release" target="_blank"><strong>Exploratorium</strong> </a>Museum on Pier 15, San Francisco.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Tactile or sense of touch is enhanced by this three story experience of hundreds of different textures, from diamond plate and sandpaper, to polycarbonate, a bed of nails and foam. There is even a slide to take you from one floor to the next. The tour takes the better part of an hour, and the most amazing feature of the exhibit is it takes place completely in the dark! The guests must feel their way through the exhibit in total darkness.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dome required a specific diameter for the display, but the steel beam rafters on the pier required the dome be oblate, or squished to fit. This is a 4 frequency, 7/12, 33&#8242; diameter, oblate geodesic dome built to Kruschke standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h3><strong>Reservations*</strong></h3>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>To make a reservation, please call (415) 528-4444 (select option 5), or make a reservation on site. Please note: Advance reservations are strongly recommended due to limited capacity and high demand. Tickets are nonrefundable and nontransferable to another person, date, or time.</p>
<p>For opening, please note that the reservations phone line opens October 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Hours</h3>
<p>Dome sessions are at 10:15 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:45 p.m., 2:15 p.m., 3:30 p.m., and 4:45 p.m. on days when the museum is open. The Dome is also operated on a drop-in basis during adult-only <strong><a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/visit/calendar/after-dark" target="_blank">After Dark</a></strong> events; tickets for these events are sold on site only on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>Each excursion lasts about an hour. During that time, you’re guaranteed one trip through the Dome. If time and operations allow, we’re happy to offer a second turn.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>In addition to the cost of admission, Tactile Dome visits are $12 for members; $15 for nonmembers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>*Please Note!</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of this experience, certain restrictions apply. Children must be at least seven years old to participate. Guests who are afraid of the dark; claustrophobic; or have back, neck, or knee injuries should not participate. Guests wearing casts are prohibited, and women in their third trimester of pregnancy should not participate. The Dome is an active experience; please wear comfortable clothes.</p>

<h2><strong>Tactile Dome: Original 1971 Press Release</strong></h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><em>The <strong>Tactile Dome</strong> is an interactive experience through total darkness. It was created in 1971 and is still a popular stop for people visiting the Exploratorium. We thought you might like to read the original press release, which provides a peek into the Tactile Dome’s history.</em></p>
<p>An internal sculpture exhibit which people will feel but never see goes on exhibit September 9, 1971 at the Exploratorium in San Francisco’s Palace of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>The exhibit, called the Tactile Dome, is encased in a geodesic dome about the size of a large weather balloon. Visitors enter through a light-lock room into a totally dark maze (path). Then, for an hour and fifteen minutes, they feel, bump, slide and crawl through and past hundreds of materials and shapes which blend, change and contrast.</p>
<p>The purpose is to disorient the sensory world so that the only sense the visitor can rely on is touch. The sensation is so outside ordinary experience that a few people panic. An attendant in a control panel can reach every part of the ant-hill like maze almost instantly.</p>
<p>Pre-opening visitors have compared the experience to being born again, turning yourself inside out head first, being swallowed by a whale, and inevitably, being enfolded in a giant womb.</p>
<p>Seemingly the tactile equivalent of a light show, the tour is actually a carefully planned and structured succession of shapes, temperatures and textures which require the full range of the touch sense to perceive.</p>
<p>The idea is to make people aware of what a complex. sensitive and under used sense touch is, and to train them to use the astonishing range of its perceptions, which include detection of pressure, pain, temperature and kinesthesia, as well as cutaneous, internal body and muscle awareness.</p>
<p>Dr. August F. Coppola, whose brainchild the exhibit is, became interested in perceptual prejudice while directing interdisciplinary studies as head of California State College’s Honors Program. He gradually came to realize that philosophy, physics and even psychology have always relied overwhelmingly on visual evidence to interpret the world.</p>
<p>“Yet the irony is that touch is still the test of reality,” said Coppola. It’s the tangible, the concrete, what you can put your finger on when your feet are on the ground.</p>
<p>Coppola believes people are actually prejudiced against the touch sense. “It’s development gets off to a bad start,” he said, “for as soon as we’ve stopped chewing our toes, the first commandment in life is given: “Don’t touch”. The Exploratorium is one of the few museums in the world where visitors are encouraged to touch and even manipulate the exhibits.”</p>
<p>One result of the touch taboo, Coppola believes, is that people become leery of physical contact with each other and the environment and that this leads to a sense of isolation and loneliness. As evidence of our overly-visual values, Coppola points to the overemphasis on fashionable clothes and the benefits of tourism. “This route leads to passive, non-participatory activities like TV watching” he said. Coppola and Carl Day, co-developer of the Tactile Dome, and gallery director at California State College in Long Beach, are leaders in an art revolution which uses people as participants in art experience rather than as targets at which to hurl artistic messages. They believe the revolution, if successful, will greatly affect not only art, advertising and industrial design but even life styles and basic beliefs.</p>
<p>Both claim that improving your haptic powers also increases your visual skills.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Domerama offers you DIY solutions for metal and timber geodesic domes. Here we&#8217;ll present a brief overview.</p>
<div id="attachment_13310" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-full wp-image-13310  " alt="A timber geodesic dome covered with polyethylene film" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/nebg_dome1.jpg" width="390" height="325" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">A timber geodesic dome covered with polyethylene film</p></div>
<h2><strong>Timber advantages over metal frame geodesic domes</strong></h2>
<p>The advantage of a geodesic timber dome is how easily it can be covered, rather inexpensively, and quickly. On the other hand, a geodesic dome made of  a metal conduit/pipe is a challenge to cover and often an expensive proposition.</p>
<p>When using wood/timber as the primary material, you can use transparent or translucent polyethylene plastic film, staple it directly on the structure, cover the staples with some silicone and then add a strip of wood for added protection and appearance.</p>
<p>And the best part is that you do not need to do much measuring because most parts are triangle shapes repeated with the use of a jig to ensure precision.</p>
<div id="attachment_13680" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 461px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-full wp-image-13680" alt="Geodesic dome plans: no special tools required" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/geodesic_dome_plans_no_special_tools.jpg" width="451" height="319" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Geodesic dome plans: no special tools required</p></div>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>For a more professional appearance</strong></h2>
<p>You can cut triangular shapes from hard plastics such as <a href="http://www.domerama.com/coverings/polycarbonate-panels/" target="_blank"><strong>polycarbonate sheets</strong></a>, glass or even <a href="http://www.domerama.com/coverings/polycarbonate-panels/" target="_blank"><strong>acrylic</strong></a>. In the plans we offer almost all only require 2 or 3 varied shapes, making the cutting of the panels a simpler operation. Instead of stapling you screw and/or glue the panels on the structure and cover the seams with silicone and strips of wood, just as for plastic in roll form.</p>
<div id="attachment_13309" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-full wp-image-13309" alt=" Jan's half GD27 geodesic dome covered in glass and used as a conservatory" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Jan_gd27_half.jpg" width="550" height="413" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Jan&#8217;s half GD27 geodesic dome covered in glass and used as a conservatory</p></div>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>A note about geodesic greenhouses</strong></h2>
<p>There are a few greenhouse manufacturers who are more than willing to sell you a geodesic greenhouse kit&#8230; Usually starting at $10 000&#8230; They do offer convenience, almost worry-free solutions. But consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping costs for your dome can be prohibitive</li>
<li>Most timber geodesic plans offered on Domerama are under $50 and are very easy to make</li>
<li>You have more control over the materials you will use</li>
<li>With a basic effort you can cut your costs to a fraction of what you pay for a kit</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not convinced you can do it yourself? click on the banner below. George did much more than the average person but you&#8217;ll get the idea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>So what&#8217;s best for your needs?</strong></h2>
<p>Here are a few basic rules when you build your own geodesic dome</p>
<ul>
<li>For a climbing dome for the kids, a timber or metal dome are both good choices</li>
<li>If you want a geodesic greenhouse, a timber dome is the preferred solution</li>
<li>For event domes of various kinds and diameters, a metal dome is usually the best option</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Torrey Smith and friends have put in a lot of effort for their preparations towards <a href="http://www.burningman.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Burning Man 2013</strong></a>. The goal was to make a geodesic dome for the Sextant Camp at Burning Man 2013 using <a href="http://www.domerama.com/calculators/3v-geodesic-dome-calculator/3v-flat-base-815-kruschke-calculator/"><strong>Domerama&#8217;s  3V 5/9 Kruschke calculator</strong></a> (resulting in a 3V flat at the base) with the following input:</p>
<p><strong>D Strut: 5.859&#8242;</strong> (That corresponds to a total strut length of exactly 6&#8242;, which is easy to transport and withstood Torrey&#8217;s bending test for &#8220;climb-ability&#8221;).  That results in a diameter of 26.6&#8242;, a height of 15.8&#8242;, and a floor area of 519 square feet.</p>
<p>And the real surprise is how the geodesic dome struts themselves were made: with waterjet cutting gear which consists in using a mixture under high pressure containing water and abrasives pushed through a tiny nozzle, creating a jet spray able to cut through metal. See the images below and the many videos describing the process.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yona Appletree and his friends are doing something different for Burning Man 2013.</p>
<p>They are building a dome where each face has been fitted with an illuminated plexiglass panel that is controlled by a computer. The computer runs custom visualization software that is interactive to music and movement.</p>
<p>They created a prototype of their final project using a 2v 16&#8242; dome using Domerama calculators. The dome shown in the video below is a 16&#8242; 2v made with 1&#8243; EMT. The full size project will (as noted) be a 38&#8242; 5v dome made with 1&#8243; EMT. The &#8220;mini&#8221; dome in the video is a 5v 36&#8243; scale model of the final project.</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObN3mfdBclA"><a href="http://www.domerama.com/yona-and-mates-making-burning-man-light-up/"><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ObN3mfdBclA/0.jpg" alt="YouTube Video"></a></p>
<p></a></div>
<p>The small dome on the inside is a model of the final project: a 5v 38&#8242; dome. It was created using brake tubing and the standard cut-press-drill-bolt process.</p>
<p><strong>Visit their website at <a href="http://beyondfire.org" target="_blank" class="broken_link">http://beyondfire.org</a> where people can see more pictures and video and get in touch with Yona and the rest of the group if you are interested in performing in the dome or teaching dance.</strong></p>
<p>Yona and friends are building the project in collaboration with Tangoed Up in Blues (<a href="http://bluestango.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link"><strong>http://bluestango.com</strong>/</a>), where the dome will serve as their dance space this year on the Playa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have just added a new section,<a href="http://www.domerama.com/types-of-domes/glass-geodesic-domes/"><strong> glass and metal greenhouses</strong></a>. For those looking for aluminum and glass geodesic dome greenhouses, Peter Ellis offers very stylish and well-built structures.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.domerama.com/types-of-domes/glass-geodesic-domes/"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13511" alt="atlantic_003" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/atlantic_003-800x600.jpg" width="695" height="521" /></a></p>
<p>We invite you to look at the other pictures Peter has provided to us by viewing the new <a href="http://www.domerama.com/types-of-domes/glass-geodesic-domes/"><strong>glass and metal greenhouse page</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Peter is also the inventor of a new type of geodesic hub. Here below is one of them. As you can see the hubs are designed to work with traditional square tubing which for many is a benefit because covering your dome is now much easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.domerama.com/types-of-domes/glass-geodesic-domes/"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13473" alt="atlantic_geodesic_dome_hub_010" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/atlantic_geodesic_dome_hub_010-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter also offers traditional domes for a variety of uses, and our favorite is how one of his domes was used by a theater troop in Ireland to put on a show for disabled kids. Not only do the actors do a great job as you can tell by the video clip below, but also the children seem to have a great time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>More Models</strong></h2>
<p>So far, I have dealt with forms generated from the icosahedron and a subdivision parallel to the original icosa face sides.</p>
<p>This can be called the &#8220;Alternate Breakdown&#8221;. This image below from part 1 describes this breakdown resulting in higher frequencies everytime you subdivide.<br />
<img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13349" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_frequencies" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_frequencies.jpg" width="700" height="199" /></p>
<p>There is another type of breakdown, and for this we must go back to the original icosa triangle. Instead of drawing lines parallel to the triangle&#8217;s sides, we draw lines peggendicular to them.</p>
<p>This is called the &#8220;Triacon Breakdown.&#8221;<br />
<img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13411" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_triacon_breakdown" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_triacon_breakdown.jpg" width="750" height="276" /></p>
<div id="attachment_13413" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 371px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-full wp-image-13413 " alt="2v Triacon" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_2v_triacon.jpg" width="361" height="345" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">2v Triacon</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Icosa face shown dotted</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_13412" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 341px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-full wp-image-13412 " alt="4v Triacon" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_4v_triacon.jpg" width="331" height="309" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">4v Triacon</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Icosa face shown dotted</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13410" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_2v_4v_triacon" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_2v_4v_triacon.jpg" width="750" height="437" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are some interesting differences between the Alternate and Triacon breakdowns. Since the triacon breakdown is symmetrical about a line drawn down the centre of the icosa triangle, the triacon is only possible in even frequencies. The alternate, however, is possible in all frequencies. In even frequency alternate breakdowns (2v, 4v, 6v) great circles are formed which divide the sphere neatly into hemispheres.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The triacon breakdown does not have this feature in any frequency. ln order to make a triacon half-sphere. some triangles have to be cut in half. The triacon requires fewer different lengths because of  its higher symmetry, but. on the other hand. the struts vary in length more than in the altemate breakdown.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Try a model and see the differences.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>To make a 4v triacon sphere you will need:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13409" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_4v_triacon_sphere" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_4v_triacon_sphere.jpg" width="750" height="278" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By now you should ?nd it fairly easy to identify different types of domes. What you do is look for a point where ?ve struts join. Then ?nd another pentagon and draw a line between them. If this line is de?ned by actual struts. then the dome is an altemate breakdown. If there are no stmts along the line. the dome is a triacon. What you are doing is picking out comers of the original icosa. The line you draw between them is an icosa edge. and counting the number of parts into which it is divided gives you the frequency of the dome.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13407" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_4v_icosahedron_4v_octahedron" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_4v_icosahedron_4v_octahedron.jpg" width="597" height="224" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Domes can also be generated from the Octahedron. They are not as round as domes generated from the icosahedron and can be easily recognised by a square where the eight octa faces meet. The Octahedron form has the distinguishing ability to be able to fuse to rectilinear forms. The Octahedron also forms a natural truncation at the hemisphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Assembly methods are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13408" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_icosahedron_octahedron" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_icosahedron_octahedron.jpg" width="750" height="301" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13406" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_2v_4v_octahedron_alternate" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_2v_4v_octahedron_alternate.jpg" width="750" height="380" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Domes can also be squashed or stretched to give an ellipsoidal form.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13404" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_egg_zafu" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_egg_zafu.jpg" width="512" height="260" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">These forms are useful if building big domes where the dome is squashed down to save both headroom and surface area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THREE FREQUENCY ICOSAHEDRON ELLIPSOID (SQUASHED)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13405" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_ellipsoid" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_ellipsoid.jpg" width="1128" height="236" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One last word on model making is to make paper or cardboard models. Use the patterns on the following pages. Punch with a pin through the paper onto thin cardboard. or trace onto paper.</p>
<p>Trace ?ve times for the Icosahedron based domes, four times for the Octahedron based domes. Either tape the gathering angles to form curved sections or add tabs on the edges which can be glued or stapled together inside. Very attractive scale models can be made by using artist&#8217;s mount board and gluing the edges together on the insides with a hot glue gun.</p>
<p>In calculating dimensions. the following formulas are useful:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">π = 114159265</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CIRCUMFERENCE OF A CIRCLE = 2 * π *R</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">AREA or A CIRCLE = π * R²</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>MODEL MAKING</strong></h1>
<p>By far the best way to see what a geodesic dome looks like is to build three dimensional models. This is not difficult and lets you see how the geometry works, what size and shape you like and possible window and door placements.</p>
<p>The best drawings and photos are inferior to the simplest model when it comes to demonstrating three dimensional relationships.</p>
<p>Playing with models can lead to the discovery of valuable insights; not to mention that they are fun to make and look beautiful too.</p>
<p>There are two basic types of model building, as is full scale dome building. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <strong>HUB AND STRUT</strong> method. ie. Building a framework and then covering it with a skin. and</li>
<li>The <strong>MEMBRANE</strong> or <strong>PANEL</strong> system. ie. Where the skin is attached to the struts in premade triangular panels and the panels are later bolted together.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before starting your first model, there are a few more simple geometric elements to become familiar with. These are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHORD FACTORS, CENTRAL ANGLES, AXIAL ANGLES, </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FACE ANGLES and DIHEDRAL ANGLES</strong></p>
<p>For each type of dome there is a method of calculating strut lengths and the angles at which they meet and how they are assembled.</p>
<p>The <strong>CHORD FACTORS</strong> are of the most importance here as they are needed to determine strut lengths.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chord Factor = 2 Sin (Central Angle/2)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STRUT LENGTH = DOME_ RADIUS X CHORD FACTOR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you have a table of chord factors you can calculate strut length for any size dome you want.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13363" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_axial_central_angles" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_axial_central_angles.jpg" width="535" height="401" />The <strong>CENTRAL ANGLE</strong> is the angle produced by extending a line from the strut ends to the centre of the sphere.</p>
<p><strong>AXIAL ANGLES</strong> are useful in hub design. They are the angles that the strut ends make with the centre of the sphere.</p>
<p><strong>Axial Angle =  180 degrees minus Central Angle /2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13364" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_face_dihedral_angles" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_face_dihedral_angles.jpg" width="847" height="191" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FACE ANGLES</strong> are the internal tip angles of the triangles and are necessary when cutting hubs and triangle panels.</p>
<p><strong>DIHEDRAL ANGLES</strong> are the angles between triangles. They are useful if you plan to bevel the skin panels or use bevelled struts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13365" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_2v_3v_breakdowns" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_2v_3v_breakdowns.jpg" width="600" height="296" /><br />
2v and 3v breakdowns with original Icosa face dotted</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13366" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_3v_icosahedron" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_3v_icosahedron.jpg" width="476" height="419" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13367" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_3v_58_chart" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_3v_58_chart.jpg" width="491" height="180" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The diagram above shows the statistics for a Three Frequency Icosahedron Dome.  To make a 5/8 sphere you will need:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13368" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_3v_strut_count" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_3v_strut_count.jpg" width="750" height="262" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Choose your method of model assembly (following pages) and assemble as in the diagram on page 8. This model will sit ?at on the 3/8 and 5/8 levels. It is simpler to join all the pentagon and hexagon spokes together ?rst. Make six pentagons from &#8220;A&#8221; struts, ten hexagons from &#8220;C&#8221; struts and ?ve &#8220;halt&#8221; hexagons for the base.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A simpler model can be made using only three strut lengths by substituting &#8220;D&#8221; struts with &#8220;B&#8221; struts and using the new chord factors of:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A = .34862       need 30</strong><br />
<strong>B = .40355       need 55</strong><br />
<strong>C = .41241        need 80</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This model <strong>will not sit flat</strong> however but will rest on the five half-hex hubs under the pentagons. For a very similar truncation (fraction of a dome), the Kruschke method is used (in this case a 5/9).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Three-frequency icosahedron spheroid</strong></h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>This e-booklet has been compiled to assist potential owner-builders of Geodesic Domes to prefabricate and erect a variety of geometric configurations utilising a number of possible construction techniques.</p>
<p>Much of the data is gleaned from long-out-of-date publications and from the author&#8217;s practical experience and experimentation in building domes since 1973.</p>
<p>Most of the ideas within have been tested and proven successful but are certainly open to further refinement and development. Rather than promoting any one system as being the &#8216;best&#8217;, I would prefer to offer ideas and possibilities to the great Australian tradition of &#8220;Do-it -yourself&#8221; and share my own experiences of what can work.</p>
<p>With this in mind I welcome any feedback about your own experiments, learning experiences and successes and invite any correspondence to share such knowledge. This manual is intended for educational purposes only.</p>
<p>It presents information on principles and techniques that the author has not necessarily employed. It is not suggested that these methods must be followed or that if followed will result in a safe or satisfactory building.</p>
<p>Due to variations in materials, quality of workmanship, tools and equipment, materials and components, local building codes etc., the author assumes no liability for any structure designed or constructed from information in this manual unless it is built by The Dome Company or our nominated sub-contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Geodesic Geometry</strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GEODESIC = The shortest line between two points on a sphere.</strong></p>
<p>There are only five different structures that we can build where all the sides, faces and angles are equal. These regular solids are called PLATONIC solids.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13353" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_platonic solids" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_platonic-solids.jpg" width="629" height="364" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of these five, we see that three are made of triangles. As we might expect, the tetrahedron,octahedron and icosahedron are rigid; while the cube and dodecahedron are not. The cube is the basis for most types of buildings. The icosahedron is the basis for most Geodesic Domes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can make small structures with icosahedrons, but if you begin to make bigger structures, the triangles get large and heavy and you begin to need big timbers for the members.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dome geometry is all about the subdivision of large triangles into smaller ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="size-full wp-image-13350 aligncenter" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_icosahedron_small" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_icosahedron_small.jpg" width="214" height="243" />An Icosahedron has twenty equilateral triangular ‘faces’. When the face is subdivided. it is not<br />
done equally, but done so that the faces begin to curve outward;this gives you more strength. Each face can be divided by a line (arcs on a sphere) parrallel to the edge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The number of divisions is called &#8220;FREQUENCY&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13349" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_frequencies" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_frequencies.jpg" width="700" height="199" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the frequency increases, the number of members or &#8220;STRUTS&#8221; and the numbel of triangles increases also, and the closer you get to a sphere.</p>
<p>The following diagram below is of a THREE FREQUENCY (3v) ICOSA 5/8 SPHERE.</p>
<p>Each of the original Icosa faces is heavily outlined. Looking at a geodesic dome on can determine the frequency by counting the number of struts between the apexes 0f the pentagons.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13354" alt="geodesic_dome_diy_truncations" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_dome_diy_truncations.jpg" width="749" height="368" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Note</strong>: divisions are different for different frequencies. See chart below for correct nomenclature</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13355" alt="geodesic_profile_fractions" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/geodesic_profile_fractions.jpg" width="455" height="246" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This article will explain how to make your own negative pressure (vacuum) projection liner for geodesic domes, for a reasonable price and of professional quality. It is inspired by a patent filed more than 35 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Our example</strong></h2>
<p><strong>First</strong>: in this example we are looking to produce a projection liner for a 15 meter (50-foot) diameter geodesic dome, the materials will be the same used by professional projection liner manufacturers. The main component of your liner is the vinyl:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because there is waste when cutting sections, let&#8217;s round the total to 400 linear yards of fire-retardant vinyl</li>
<li>2-layer projection liner 400 linear yards X $20 = $8,000 of vinyl material</li>
</ul>
<p>Next is the frame holding up the projection liner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Frame</strong></h2>
<p>The other component to this projection liner is the frame to hold up the projection liner. Look at the images below:</p>
<p><img style=' float: left; padding: 4px; margin: 0 7px 2px 0;'  class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-13020" alt="projection_patent_fig3" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/projection_patent_fig3-300x277.jpg" width="350" height="322" /></p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13022" alt="projection_patent_fig2" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/projection_patent_fig2-283x300.jpg" width="283" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The frame is slightly smaller than the geodesic dome. Its sections slide one into the other, just like top rails on a fence or electrical or plumbing conduit. To curve the metal to mimic the shape of the dome, a little math is required, but basically almost any metal shop can bend the pipe, and quickly. The end result is an easy-to-assemble frame.</p>
<p>A fairly generous estimate for the cost of a frame to hold up the projection liner is approximately $5000. Actually it&#8217;s a high estimate and almost any pipe can be used since it will never show (it&#8217;s between the two vinyl layers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How you end up with up a very nice projection surface</strong></h2>
<p>The principle is simple: the outer layer is sealed to the inner layer and the metal frame holds up both layers. Connector an air pump to an opening and turn it on to create a suction.</p>
<p>You need only one location to suck the air out evenly because the negative pressure (vacuum) will equalize itself all over.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: if you use vinyl which weighs 16 oz  per square yard, , this means your liner will weigh hundreds of pounds/kilograms. In our example, a single layer of vinyl is 4000 square feet, and we need two layers, for a total of 8000 square feet. At 18 ounces per square yard, the liner will weigh 900 pounds or more than 400 kilograms.</strong></p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13021" alt="projection_patent_fig4" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/projection_patent_fig4.jpg" width="750" height="353" /></p>
<p>When air is suctioned out between the two layers, the inner layers forms a natural dome shape. An important note is how the frame is assembled, then the projection liner is thrown ovet the frame, and for a final touch, both layers are sealed at the the base.</p>
<p><strong>Here is your current total (retail):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$8000 for fabric</li>
<li>$5000 for the frame</li>
</ul>
<p>The next cost is making the 2 liner shapes.</p>
<p>You need to create two  half spheres (like an umbrella). the bigger one for the outer layer, the smaller one for the interior layer, the one on which you project. Vinyl is heat welded. If you don&#8217;t know where to go, try truck tarp makers; they heat weld vinyl on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It should not take more than 3 days of work to assemble the sections together. But if you do not pre-cut the sections yourself, expect 4 days of shop work, 8 hours per day, $80/hour.</p>
<p><strong>Your current total is now:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$8000 for fabric</li>
<li>$5000 for the frame</li>
<li>$3000 for heat welding of vinyl sections (rounded higher)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add the cost for a blower/ pump: $300. Your total is under $17,000</strong></p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s propose an extreme situation: let&#8217;s say our final cost is actually $10,000 more than estimated. Your investment is now $27,000. Keep in mind we are using retail pricing for all components.</p>
<p>Dome manufacturers will sell you a 15 meter (50 foot), 3-layer version for a reasonable&#8230; $65,000, plus shipping, plus a team to set it up.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s almost 2.5 times more than our DIY estimate for a comparable product. Even if you add a third layer to our DIY solution, it remains around twice the price of what a dome manufacturer offers. And this also includes that extra $10,000 we added for fun. But let&#8217;s be fair: companies need to make a profit, though it seems quite expensive to purchase one. And you still need a team to install and take off the liner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many geodesic event domes suppliers love to sell you on incredibly expensive event solutions. In a niche business it is expected to be expensive, and it almost always is.</p>
<p>But the ultimate waste of money promoted by event dome sellers is the  the negative vacuum/pressure projection system.</p>
<p>Those event dome suppliers who will suggest a negative-pressure projection system, a fancy expression for an system holding the projection fabric in place via a vacuum effect, are not offering you the best option for your event.</p>
<p>Many years ago dome sellers started using this patented method, and for a lack of options or most likely laziness,  continue to offer it. But it is not the best one out there.  A negative pressure/vacuum system is a pretty good solution for smaller domes, but anything bigger than 35 feet (11 meters) is not smart.</p>
<p>And even then, it&#8217;s pushing the boundaries of common financial sense. A negative pressure projection liner does do its job, but the majority of sellers demand an unrealistic amount. Why? Because they are very much aware that the liner they rent out may stay in storage a long time until is is used again, and so it is very likely the rental amount is same or more than purchasing the item.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12702" alt="pureblondeinside" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/pureblondeinside.jpg" width="362" height="270" /></p>
<p>In the image  above, projection is displayed on a geodesic event dome&#8217;s cover, something that may not be acceptable to clients. The alternative is to use multiple layers of fabric for a smooth, rounded projection surface and to hide the geodesic structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why the negative pressure/vacuum projection system sucks<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>It consists of  three layers of PVC or similar material. You plug in the air blower which creates a vacuum between two layers and the result is a nice rounded shape. If a power outage occurs, your projection surface surface comes down. For outside use, a power backup source can be installed to immediately compensate, but if your dome is located inside and your backup is a generator,  it will be very noisy.</p>
<p>The greatest criticism about the negative pressure/vacuum projection system is the cost. A typical solution using this system for a complete 36-foot (11meter) diameter dome will easily set you back $40,000, and this is before shipping, taxes, installation and other related costs.

<h2><strong>Many dome sellers are snobs</strong></h2>
<p>If you mention inflatable domes to a metal conduit dome seller they will have a prepared list of criticism regarding them. In addition, they know very little about inflatable domes other than they require air to be set up. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflatables are the products that can compete with metal domes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Most inflatable domes are manufactured in Asia, and so costs tend to be much lower than metallic domes. Also, geodesic covers are much less expensive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inflatable domes do not require as much technical expertise and equipment to set up, and this cuts into the metal event dome seller&#8217;s profit margin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inflatable domes are far from perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the power goes out the structure deflates</li>
<li>It requires a very firm attachment to the ground</li>
<li>Not all inflatable have nice rounded shapes for good projection results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues are not difficult to address, though traditional event dome sellers will repeat them continuously because it is their natural competitor. The solution for the client or end user is a hybrid one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>So what is the alternative?</strong></h2>
<p>In short: consider a traditional inflatable projection dome inside a traditional geodesic structure. These are inflated like a giant balloon, and their interior surface is often designed for projection.</p>
<p>Stay away from inflatables which inflate the inside of the dome to stay up (ex: soccer domes). The right choice is a dome which inflates its wall to remain upright. This way there is no need to keep the dome sealed at all times.</p>
<p>If you opt for the inflatable projection solution, be aware there are varying degrees of quality and construction; for example, one inflatable may have a much smoother surface than another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A variation on the negative pressure concept is available by clicking on the banner below:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.domerama.com/diy-geodesic-dome-projection-liners/"><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter" alt="diy_projection_liner_banner" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/diy_projection_liner_banner.jpg" width="378" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Two solution: one sucks and the other blows?</strong></h2>
<p>The difference is a lot of money, and we mean a lot of valuable money. Expect an inflatable dome to be less than half  the cost of the negative pressure/vacuum system (most suppliers are sourced from Asia). To secure the inflatable dome, put it inside a geodesic dome structure. Funny thing: that is exactly what is done for negative pressure systems. but at a much higher cost.</p>
<p>Not only will you save large amounts of money, but it would be easy to store the inflatable dome for future events. If you believe negative projection liners are the best fit for you, consider clicking on the banner above for a solution about half the price of what dome sellers offer.</p>

<p>Bucky was not an architect, nor an engineer, and actually explains his patent for geodesic geometry.</p>
<p><strong>TC Howard</strong> was one of several talented architects who were overshadowed by Bucky.  Shoji Sadao was Bucky&#8217;s partner who designed the 67 Montreal Expo Pavilion with Geometrics, Inc.  All of the Geometrics, Inc architects, Don Richter for Kaiser domes and Temcor  and Jeffrey Lindsay.  TC Howard is synonymous with Synergetics, Inc.</p>
<div id="attachment_11170" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-full wp-image-11170" alt="Montreal Expo 67 U.S. pavillion" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Picture-13.png" width="400" height="298" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Montreal Expo 67 U.S. pavillion</p></div>
<p>There is an over-abundance  of architectural firms, and it took a flamboyant person like Bucky to grab the attention and get the commissions.  Bucky was well known and had great connections, and originally pioneered the idea to make prefabricated housing to bring  down the price of owning a home.</p>
<p>He was not interested in building larger domes.  TC never designed houses.  TC helped prove that the larger the geodesic dome the stronger it became.  Bucky did not want to be in the dome building business.  Kaiser aluminum saw the dome industry as a new use for supplying aluminum.</p>
<div id="attachment_11171" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 515px;  border: 1px solid #dddddd; background-color: #f3f3f3; padding-top: 4px; margin: 10px; text-align:center; display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"><img class="size-large wp-image-11171" title="Union Tank Car Dome" alt="Union Tank Car Dome" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/union_car_dome-800x492.jpg" width="505" height="310" /><p style=' padding: 0 4px 5px; margin: 0;'  class="wp-caption-text">Union Tank Car Dome</p></div>
<p>Union Tank Car foresaw the potential also:  they bought the rights to the UTC dome plans and were going to start manufacturing more.  North American Aviation saw the decline of air crafts and also wanted to expand into the dome business:  ASM dome and the Climatron.</p>

<p>A 15 meter (50 foot) geodesic dome frame is something you won&#8217;t see too often. The dome has a misting water system in it and by golly, they will be needing it today at the <a href="http://www.bigdayout.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Big Day Out festival </strong></a>presently in Sydney this weekend.  As some parts of North America went down to the coldest weather yet this winter, it was the complete opposite in Australia. Keep in mind, it&#8217;s currently summer down under.</p>
<p>On related news, I just looked at the thermometer: -24 Celsius (that&#8217;s really cold in Fahrenheit).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div itemprop="step">
<p>Glass used to be the method most used to cover greenhouses. Now it has been replaced by plastics, mainly acrylic (plexiglass) and polycarbonate (Lexan) sheets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Quick facts about acrylic and polycarbonate</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Acrylic is 17 times more resistant to impacts than glass and weighs half as much. Polycarbonate is 250 times more resistant to impacts compared to glass and is half its weight</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Acrylic is the less expensive option and clearer than glass; more rigid than polycarbonate, easy to scratch and tends to be more affected by chemicals. Polycarbonate is more flexible, more resistant to chemicals and abrasion, but it costs twice as much as acrylic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Both polycarbonate and acrylic have a light transmittance ranging from 88% to 92% of glass (acrylic is clearer than glass and transmits more light than polycarbonate).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Both glass alternatives have one factor in common: they will shrink as the temperature drops</strong></p>
<p>The shrink rate of either material varies on factors such as the manufacturing process and raw materials used, but for a typical greenhouse, the shrinkage will be noticeable. To remedy this, the solution is to use &#8220;channels&#8221; to hold the panels in place while solving the shrinking issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How channels work</strong></h2>
</div>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10964" alt="poly_h_channel" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/poly_h_channel-300x265.jpg" width="257" height="228" /></p>
<p>Panels are slipped in between 2 channels. The fit is snug with just a slight amount of wiggle room. In situations where the temperature is low, such as in winter, the long lips of the channel ensure that the panel will not fall. The result is that there is no stress on the panel and the greenhouse remains watertight.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10965" alt="poly_h_channel_installation" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/poly_h_channel_installation.jpg" width="305" height="271" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When glazing a geodesic greenhouse, H channels are on each side of every panel and each side will need to be shorter to accommodate the space used for the channel.</p>
<p>The more layers a polycarbonate panel has, the greater the insulating value it will have. It is common to see double layer panels for greenhouses.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/polycarbonate_layers.jpg" width="245" height="214" /></p>

<p>Ever see a geodesic dome greenhouse kit assembly? Many are considering putting up a geodesic greenhouse , but few ever saw one being assembled.</p>
<p><strong>Don S. Collins</strong> was kind enough to let us publish his story of how he went to visit a couple of friends to assemble their geodesic greenhouse kit, complete with polycarbonate glazing and a heat collector among other features. The pieces were pre-drilled and measured to make it easier to put together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I admit it may seem mean, but seeing garage shelters implode in the winter time puts a smile on my face.  Why? Because it proves that being dumb does not make a garage shelter more resistant against Mother Nature. The owner of this garage shelter knew the structure was weak but still put it up. What&#8217;s worse is that manufacturers convince people it&#8217;s a good idea.  In Canada&#8217;s northeast? Are you friggin&#8217; kidding me? And this one was protected by a building (which no snow or water fell from its roof onto the shelter).</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10930" alt="tempo_crap_shelter_1" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tempo_crap_shelter_1.jpg" width="501" height="366" /></p>
<p>This is a classic case of a supplier overselling his product just to make more money, and the suckers who bought the sales pitch. As you can see from the image above, the thing just fell apart following a snow storm followed by melting snow weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><img style=' float: left; padding: 4px; margin: 0 7px 2px 0;'  class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10931" alt="tempo_crap_shelter_2" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tempo_crap_shelter_2.jpg" width="375" height="331" />Garage shelter suppliers are great hypnotists</strong></h2>
<p>Somehow, companies have convinced people that shelters are great to protect your vehicle from snow. But all that snow they promise you won&#8217;t have to shovel is on top of your shelter, accumulating after each storm.</p>
<p>Look at the image on the left: that is just one of the many boulders of snow on the roof of the garage shelter. We had to cut many holes in the roof to remove these giants to get the ATV out. Oh, and the ATV&#8217;s protecting roof broke under the weight of the snow because the ATV was the only reason the entire thing did not cave in all the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Your garage shelter vs. your house roof</strong></h2>
<p>A house roof is designed to support its own weight and the accumulation of snow during the winter. So why on Earth would a skimpy frame made of thin tubing become strong enough to support 18-24 inches of snow? It may support the weight for a while, but the moment that snow becomes wet or another snow fall happens, your temporary structure is on its way to buckle. And this is what happened to this particular shelter.</p>
<p>Bottom line here: temporary shelters are not a good solution in most winter climates. Those who insist using them are the first to reinforce the structure with bracing and additional wood. So that means&#8230; People who don&#8217;t know any better buy these shelters, and those who do know better also buy them, but they reinforce the hell out of them&#8230; Uh, what?</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10933" alt="tempo_crap_shelter_4." src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tempo_crap_shelter_4..jpg" width="500" height="215" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>OK, so what&#8217;s my alternative?</strong></h2>
<p>There is no moral here; traditionally-shaped shelters have their uses, but if you have the space for it, a geodesic dome might be a better solution. I live in the countryside, so a dome is not far-fetched where quonset (half-moon) structures  are common. And you can also throw a metal or plastic mesh over the frame before you put on the tarp, making it even more resistant to snow load.</p>
<p>Still, seeing these babies implode makes for fun pictures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many are unfairly branded with the &#8220;hippie&#8221; label for wanting to build a geodesic dome. Some call dome homes &#8220;mushroom houses&#8221;, even real estate and insurance companies sometimes don&#8217;t know how to deal with financing or insuring a dome home. The shame befalling a geodesic worshiper grows when referred to as a &#8220;strut lover&#8221;. But worse is how critics are always pointing and asking: &#8220;What&#8217;s your angle?&#8221; and not being able to answer to 7 decimal places.</p>
<p>This has caused much distress and we here at the Domerama Geodesics Pentagonial Church of our Lady of Tensegrity, do not discriminate on the basis of your personal tastes and beliefs(but we do look down on those who believe the moon landings were filmed on a stage in New Mexico).</p>
<p>Please support our awareness campaign to show that being geodesic does not automatically make you a hippie.</p>

<p>Many visitors to Domerama are interested in building an inexpensive greenhouse that will last, be practical and nice to look at. This geodesic dome greenhouse project below is a must-see.</p>
<p>See how George decided to build a geodesic dome greenhouse last March 2012, and follow him every step along the way by reading his detailed observations and through more than 90 images taken during the project. It&#8217;s one of the most detailed geodesic dome greenhouse project we have found up to now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This could be your new floor for the geodesic dome, geodesic greenhouse, maybe even your yurt. Why? Because it&#8217;s almost free, it&#8217;s surprisingly sturdy and it will last for a very long time.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter" alt="ppile" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ppile.jpg" width="400" height="271" /></p>
<p>Wood pallets make an inexpensive floor or deck. Some are free, others are not. But many pallets being given away are more than acceptable for your geodesic dome or yurt flooring. They may not look pretty sometimes, but once you cover them with plywood, OSB or aspenite, even paint them, no one will know.  The pallets serve as a frame under the actual floor and their shape makes the ideal to lay 4&#8242;X 8&#8242; sheets over them.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10258" alt="wplt" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wplt.jpg" width="400" height="298" /></p>
<p>Assembling the pallets together is quite simple: line up similar pallets and drill or nail them together. One of the best part of using pallets is that they have much of the hard work done, so no cutting or measuring; just attach them to each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Preparation is key to a solid base</strong></h2>
<p>Your surface under the pallets should be graded and flat. Then you may need to tamp the soil. This may not be required. In the back of our house the ground contains pit run, a combination of various sizes of rocks mixed in with sand, clay and soil, making the surface hard as concrete. All we needed to do was to fill out some spots to make the surface evenly flat; for those areas we did take soil from around the property and then tamped it.</p>
<p>Next we lay down a layer of poly film, commonly found in hardware and garden centers. This will serve to stop growth of plants. Ideally a black plastic film is preferred.</p>
<p>The final step is to lay down a layer of sand over the surface. The thickness is up to you, though we recommend at least 2 inches (5cm). This layer should also be tamped to even it out.</p>
<p><img style=' display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;'  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10259" alt="geodesic_wood_pallet_floor" src="http://www.domerama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/geodesic_wood_pallet_floor.jpg" width="756" height="501" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Covering the wood pallets with flooring</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>For cost reasons, OSB (used in roofing as an alternative to plywood) is about half the cost of plywood and very resistant to weather conditions. If you cut parts off an OSB sheet, remember to seal the cut with an appropriate paint or sealant because humidity could leak into the sheet over time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Plywood or OSB, it is a good idea to paint the sheets if you do not cover your surface with anything else. A good quality preservative is also a good idea</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you do cover your plywood or OSB surface with a floating floor for example, a layer of insulation is recommended (as in a regular floor covering).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you do not not cover the pallets at all, consider using a thicker layer of poly film as water spilled from above may form puddles under the pallets. Your best option is to create natural drains  in the sand layer (a series of small ditches running from the center to the outer edge).  You should also consider adding a second layer of poly film above the sand layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
